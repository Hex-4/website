                <Project title="Personal website" link="https://example.com" source="Hex-4/website" badge="shipped">
                    You're here right now! After many, many iterations, (hopefully) this is the last. Made with my usual stack (Astro, Tailwind + Catppuccin, Cloudflare Pages) but this time I used this shiny new library called <a class="underline underline-offset-4   transition-all hover:font-extrabold hover:underline-offset-8 decoration-wavy hover:text-yellow" href="https://rombo.co/tailwind">tailwindcss-motion</a> for these fancy animations.
                </Project>
                <Project title="Galaxium//ONE" link="https://the-dimaverse.itch.io/galaxiumone" badge="frozen">
                    My first publicly released game, made with the Lazy Devs shump tutorial in PICO-8. Also has two content updates!
                </Project>
                <Project title="Big Slime, Lil' Slime" link="https://the-dimaverse.itch.io/galaxiumone" source="Hex-4/gmtk-2024" badge="frozen">
                    I'm really proud of this one. Made in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2024, placing #3617 out of over 7000 games. All art and code is original, with some AMAZING music by Kevin MacLeod. Open it in Godot to take a peek inside!
                </Project>
				<Project title="NixOS dots" link="https://github.com/Hex-4/nixos" source="Hex-4/nixos" badge="dev">
					My NixOS configuration! I use Flakes and Home Manager. It also contains my in-progress Hyprland rice.
                </Project>
                <Project title="potatoe simlater." link="https://the-dimaverse.itch.io/potatoe" badge="frozen">
                    I have no idea why I made this.
                </Project>
                <Project title="Hexapad" link="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2133e09e1f245de59bbe7858/w/b4533889f6300572d81eb032/e/b0c575e6e2f32d509dfa7b54" source="Hex-4/hexapad" badge="shipped">
                    A fun macropad with a "jewel" of NeoPixels, and OLED screen, a rotary encoder, and 16 switches.
                </Project>
				<Project title="Super" link="https://modrinth.com/modpack/super" badge="shipped">
                    My minecraft setup! Super immersive and... juicier.
                </Project>
				<Project title="Hobbit" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1STzwj9wrw" source="Hex-4/hobbit" badge="shipped">
                    My first discord bot, made for a server me and my friends run. It's also the first time I've used a database in a project, and I don't know what I was scared of. TinyDB is awesome. It's got an economy (different from the usual - currency is granted for participating in community events), message scheduling, and various brainrot references.
                </Project>
				<Project title="untitled-study-dashboard" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E0CbYZcjE" source="Hex-4/untitled-study-dashboard" badge="dev">
                    Haven't started on this one yet, but I'm planning to make a nice dashboard for getting things done. It'll have various widgets that you can arrange, like a music player, todo list, pomodoro timer, etc.
                </Project>
				<Project title="superscript" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E0CbYZcjE" source="Hex-4/superscript" badge="abandoned">
					Made for the Hack Club langjam. A fun, easy to use, beginner-friendly programming language for automating things. Abandoned after I realized I was copying an example langjam project, <a class="underline underline-offset-4   transition-all hover:font-extrabold hover:underline-offset-8 decoration-wavy hover:text-mauve" href="https://aurora-lang.org/">Aurora</a>. 

					Cool name though.
                </Project>
				<Project title="Hidden Gems" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E0CbYZcjE" source="Hex-4/hidden-gems" badge="abandoned">
					Currently on hold. Was a directory of cool toys, games, explainers, and other things that aligned with my vision of a creative, individual internet.
                </Project>
				<Project title="Gummies" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E0CbYZcjE" source="Hex-4/gummies" badge="abandoned">
					On hold. Fun little helper scripts, sweetened with <a class="underline underline-offset-4   transition-all hover:font-extrabold hover:underline-offset-8 decoration-wavy hover:text-pink" href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum">Gum</a>, the TUI toolkit by Charm.

					A package manager was planned, which was pretty cool.
